To generate the tests, simply invoke the Generate_Tests.py Python script.

> python Generate_Tests.py -c <name of csc>

> python Generate_Tests.py -h
usage: Generate_Tests.py [-h] -c CSC

Determine which CSC to generate State Machine tests.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -c CSC, --csc CSC  For which CSC do you want to generate tests?


The process will create a folder in the same directory as the script called robotframework_<csc> and populate it with several files.

The m1m3_StateMachine_Tests.robot file is the actual test suite.
The GlobalVars.robot file contains configuration values.
The <csc>_LocalVars.txt file auguments those values and includes runtime settings.  NOTE: This file must be editied prior to running the tests.
The common.robot file is a resource file containing commonly used keywords.  This will prove useful as the tests are expanded.
The Library/<csc>_SAL.py is a library that instantiates the SAL Python APIs into a Robot-Framework library, basically turning the SAL APIs into RF Keywords.
Finally, the RobotFramework_Install_Setup_Usage_Instructions.txt contains instructions for the installation, setup and usage of Robot-Framework.
